# Rusher 

A simple launcher utility based on dmenu wrote in Rust. 


Widgets implemented:

- Calculator
- Dictionary(sdcv)
- Weather(ansiweather)
- Timezone
- Currency convertor(fixer.io)


## Why

Originally this project is part of my dotfiles and wrote in Bash and Ruby script. I thought it was fun to rewrite it with a system language. Apparently the process is not fun at all for a Rubist. But I'm glad that I made it finally.
